Last updated December 2021 - This guide is a living document and is designed to establish standards across the Metro Digital touchpoints and related teams.

## Empathy

We're committed to being inclusive and establishing a dialogue with you to ensure we're actively creating experiences that center around your experience with Metro.

## Educational

Because the digital experience can change so quickly it's important to guide Metro and you through our process to have proper expectations on project outcomes. That means educating ourselves (Metro) and those who are impacted by our work so they understand that Digital is always changing and we need to continuously learn, grow and share in order to provide a fulfilling experience.

## Transparency

We will be transparent about what we're planning to work on and why, provide updates on progress, wins and lessons learned through various platforms so that it's easily accessible.

## Fearless

We will always be an advocate for you, our riders and neighbors when working with the rest of the agency. We are making a conscious choice to be open and honest in our approach to projects. You will see us succeed, you will see us fail, you will see us learn and grow all with the goal of making Metro and your riding experience better.

## Collaborative

We believe that innovation depends on collaboration with you, our partners and other transit agencies to find an equitable solution that improves your Metro experience. We don't have all the answers, but collaborating early and often allows us to learn from each other to make improvements.

## Community

Our transit system and our projects connect LA. As neighbors we have a responsibility to regularly ride the system and cultivate a transit-oriented community that doesn't marginalize you, our neighbors and our riders.

We will provide the opportunity for you to contribute and be part of the solution on how we improve Metro.

## Sustainable

We will make every effort to push digital solutions when they can provide a similar or better experience. Our solutions will be effective and user friendly tools that can be sustainable for the long-term.

## Helpful

Listen always. Simplify what we have, provide honest answers to what we don't. We value your time and will always advocate for the most helpful solution.
