# GitHub Basics

Here is the link to the slides for the [workshop](./media/workshop9_10_21.pdf).

To begin, visit the GitHub repository for the documentation here:

 - [https://github.com/LACMTA/digital-services-team-docs/](https://github.com/LACMTA/digital-services-team-docs/tree/dev){target=_blank}

Most changes should be made onto the `dev` branch or your own branch.

!!! note
    If you do not have access to the repository, you can request access from [Albert][albert-kochaphum] or [Nina][nina-kin]. Otherwise you will end up forking the repository and will need to make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from your own repository. Learn more about forking here:
    https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/.
