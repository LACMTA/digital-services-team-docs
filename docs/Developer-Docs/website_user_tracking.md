# Website User Tracking

## Overview

On [metro.net](../../_Projects/Lifeboat/metrobeta.md) and other Metro sites, we often have the need to track user behavior.  Use Google Analytics for tracking general numbers of page hits (along with user location, technology, etc. information).  Use Google Tag Manager for tracking interactions within a page or to track user progression through a campaign across platforms (for example, through a Facebook ad buy).

Our primary contractor partner this work is Civilian.
