### Tail Ads

Tail Ads go on the back of all Metro Buses. The bus type does not matter. All buses use the same template, and are then trimmed down to fit each bus type when being placed on the bus. This is why the Live Area spec is very important. Anything outside of this area could be cut off depending on the bus.

### Train Wrap

There are three types of train wraps we have access to within our fleet. The first thing you need to know before beginning designing a train wrap is finding out which train type will be wrapped. All rail lines use fully wrapped trains, minus the B (Red) and D (Purple) Lines.

## Print Shop

*Print specs forms are only needed for offset and digital press projects.*
*No print specs forms needed for: epson, paperboard, falconboard or coroplast.*

### Decals
- maximum print area width for the decal machine is 50”
- most are die-cut to a die
- if no die-cut, then add bleed and crop marks


### Digital Press Specs

**SIZE**

- We tend to run most projects on 12” x 18” or 13” x 19” sheets
- Max sheet size is 13” x 27.5” (printable area? to be confirmed)
- As of April 2018, we now have the ability to print digital envelopes up to 13” x 10”

 
**WEIGHT**

- Max weight stock is 18 pt

 
**COLORS**

- 4 color process + optional gloss spot or overall varnish
- We’re still working on PMS colors

 
**FINAL FILES**

- PDF or native files ok. Just as regular print jobs.

 
**QUANTITIES**

- We try to keep quantities below 5,000 impressions.
- Example, contact cards may request 20,000 quantity but we can run those 24 up on a sheet so the run is only 850.
- We’ll discuss on a job by job basis.

**TIMING**

- Would like at least 3 working days, depending on quantity.


### Multi-Page Books

**Saddle-stitch books**

- Package InDesign files as normal
- Export 2 PDFs, both in single pages, not spreads:
    - 1 without crops or bleeds for viewing and/or web
    - 1 with crops and bleeds for printing (mechanical file)
- If the cover is a different paper stock than the interior pages, create two separate packages labelled clearly as COVER and PAGES
- Typically, saddle-stitch good for up to 48 pages, after that the book won’t lay flat

 
**Wire Binding**

- Singles pages with crops and bleed
- 3/8” is the minimum margin to account for wire

**Perfect Binding**

- make sure to design the spine

## TAP
### Commemorative TAP Cards

*(OR refer to the PDF on the server found under:*
*Resources > TAP > 16-0220_Commemorative_TAP_card_Template_eh)* 

**To prepare Production Files:**

- Refer to the Final Files in Job 19-3055, the Obama TAP card, on the server for how to prepare your Final Files (EPS, AI, PDF, and JPG).
- Observe the Trim, Bleed, and Production lines (and layers) in each of these and, for each Final File, take note which line your artwork should reach.


1. **make the AI file:** Open 19-3055’s AI Final File in Illustrator. Adapt your artwork to it. “Save as” and “save as” to your filename.
2. For the next steps, use your newly made Final .AI File but do not save over it.
3. **make the EPS file**: Open 19-3055’s EPS file in Illustrator. Open your new AI file, adjust to/match the layout of 19-3055’s EPS, and “save as” EPS format.
4. **make the JPG file:** Open 19-3055’s JPG in Preview or Photoshop. Use your new AI file, match the layout of 19-3055’s JPG, and export your JPG with the setting at 300 dpi.
5. **make the PDF file:** Open 19-3055’s PDF in Illustrator. Use your newly made Final AI file, match the layout of 19-3055’s PDF, and “save as” a PDF.

Submit all four files to TAP.

## Vinyl Banners
### Vinyl Banner Types

as of May 2015

#### **CUSTOM VINYL BANNERS**
These are vinyl banner materials with no frames.

- **Dimensions**
    - 62” max height (if banner is taller than this, it must be sent out for production).
    - 100’ max width (if banner is longer than this, we can accommodate in-house and attach multiple banners together).
    - The entire 62” x 100’ live area is for artwork.
- **Use**
    - These may or may not include grommets (AE is responsible for this information).
    - Including wind slits for banners used on chain link fences or outdoor where there is air flow is highly recommended!
    - Wind slits are not needed if being mounted on a solid wall, building, etc.
- **Production**
    - Metro Print Shop: Banners no taller than 62” high – produced in in the Print Shop are done @ no charge to client.
    - Outside Printer: Banners taller than 62” high – AE to determine who is paying for before opening outside produced banners + install jobs.
    - AE should discuss with client, Production and Promotions/Events teams the details of banner installation (i.e., team of staff? Facilities Maintenance? Outside Vendor?) each and every time a job is opened.

#### **ROLL-UP BANNERS**
The banner artwork comes with the frame as one unit. The artwork is NOT interchangeable. The banner can be made of vinyl or another material. These banners can’t include wind slit and are not weather-proof so should be used indoor only. They come with a zip case.

- **Dimensions**
    - The dimensions depend on the vendor (AE is responsible for this information).
    - Vendor and dimensions should be determined before an AE opens the job. This greatly impacts the designers.
- **Use**
    - Since the artwork on these can NOT be changed, these should be used for evergreen purposes only.
- **Production**
    - AE should determine who is paying for the banners before opening the job.
    - The final artwork should be sent to the vendor for production of the banner. The banner artwork comes with the frame as one unit.
- **Misc**
    - If client is keeping the roll-up banners, AE should recommend the client purchase 30lb sand bags at www.sandbagstore.com/.

#### **ADJUSTABLE STAND VINYL BANNERS**
The banner artwork comes with the frame as one unit; however, the artwork is INTERCHANGEABLE, so we can create new artwork and swap the creative out.

- **Dimensions**
    - DEFAULT (Media Press Event): 35” wide by 78” high
    - Minimum: 24” wide by 59” high
    - Maximum: 39” wide by 78” high
    - Although the dimensions are adjustable, the AEs should use the DEFAULT dimension of 35” wide by 78” high when opening a job. This is the size currently used at Media Press Events.
    - Vendor and dimensions should be determined before an AE opens the job. This greatly impacts the designers.
- **Use**
    - Including wind slits for banners used outdoor where there is air flow is optional, but highly recommended.
- **Production**
    - AE should determine who is paying or the banners before opening the job.
    - For grommets, a dot should be placed ¼” away from each corner of the banner to indicate where the hole should go.
    - Vendor: Final artwork should be sent to the vendor for production whenever a new frame is being ordered. The banner artwork comes with the frame as one unit; however, the artwork is INTERCHANGEABLE, so we can create a new banner and swap out the old one with the new one. When placing the initial order for the stand+banner through the vendor at http://www.paradigmdisplaysolutions.com/notus-smart-banner-stand/ the two choices are a 24”x78” vinyl banner or a 39”x78” banner.
    - Metro Print Shop: Vinyl banners that will replace the original banner artwork that came with the frame are always produced at the Metro print Shop.
- **Misc**
    - To ground the banner, fill half to full of the base with sand. Metro recommends filling it hallway with sand. You can purchase a bag of play sand at http://www.homedepot.com
    - If client is keeping the roll-up banners, AE should recommend the client purchase 30lb sand bags at www.sandbagstore.com/.

### Vinyl Banner Specs (Metro Print Shop)

**CUSTOM VINYL BANNER**

- 62″ high x variable length (63″ Stock) – we recommend max 60″ high

**FILE FORMAT**

- PDF
- 100% size
- no bleeds
- no crop marks
- CMYK
- OK to include a hairline to indicate trim if there are any white edges
- Outline fonts

**FINAL FILES FOR VERY LONG BANNERS**

- Final banners should have a maximum length of 50-60′ (FEET) at actual banner size (otherwise its too cumbersome and heavy to manage), so if longer than 50-60′ at actual size – plan for final art to be produced into smaller, multiple banners
- Maximum width artboard in AICC is 18.75′ (FEET)
- Only ONE artboard per PDF file
- Vincent will tile together single page PDF files and print as one continuous banner if needed

**GROMMETS**

- Place small dots 1/8″ in diameter to indicate grommet placement (grommets are a little larger than 1/4″)
- Position 3/4″ in from banner edges on all outside edges
- Space approx. 1.5 – 2′ (FEET) apart, divided equally on all outside edges
- Only place grommets on outside edges of banners – may not need on every artboard if tiling artboards as above
- FYI every 5′ of banner requires approx 30 mins to apply grommets and trim by Production team

**FINISHING**

- Wind slits will be hand-cut by Production team
- Note: no trimming or stitching capabilities

**MATERIALS AVAILABLE**
