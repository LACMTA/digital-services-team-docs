# Guiding Principles and Values

[Design Justice Presentation - 10/15/2021](media/Metro_Design_Justice_10_15_2021.pdf)

_This guide is designed to establish standards across the Metro Digital touchpoints and related teams._

## Mission/Goal

To bring our customers into every stage of the design process in order to build great digital products for the greatest number of people. We will do this by focusing on inclusivity, reducing barriers and providing a Digital Customer Experience that is easy, fast, safe and reliable. This will build trust which will translate to better engagement, retention and affinity for Metro and our brand.

## Our Values align with what our Customer Value

### Fast

Whether it&#39;s **faster travel options** or finding related riding information, we want our customers to complete their task as quickly as possible.

### Easy

**Our customers have more convenient options.** A seamless customer experience with accurate data suited to how and where they want it will provide a **better trip** experience and make riding Metro a more competitive option.

### Safe

Digital has an ability to influence and promote a safer customer experience from before they ride to after they get to their destination. **Our customers deserve peace of mind.**

### Reliable

**Our customers should be able to trust us.** Digital should always be working on making what is in our control more accurate, timely and stable.

### Accessible

Availability does not equal accessibility. We want to work with our customers and the communities we serve to get rid of the barriers that create differentiation and separation. To provide equal access to everyone, regardless of identity factors.

### Equitable

Everyone should be provided the information or action they need in the form they need it in order to have a successful experience with Metro. 2.8 million customers rely on Metro.net every year to navigate our system, provide input on projects, look for a job, do business with the agency and give us feedback on their experience. In terms of direct contact with our customers, the website stands shoulder to shoulder with ridership on our system.

### Sustainable Project Management

Long-term maintenance needs and resource allocation is vital to a great CX. Our customer needs fundamentally don&#39;t change. The ways we address them do.

Recognize that from the perspective of our customers, no solution is perfect, therefore everything is a prototype and we should ensure we have the time, money and resources to continue refining the CX.

### Accountability

Fiscally responsible and consistent evaluation and iteration of our Customer Experience to ensure Metro priorities continue to align with customer needs.

## Design Principles

_The following Principles are verbatim from_ [_gov.uk_](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)

### 1. Start with user needs

Service design starts with identifying user needs. If you don&#39;t know what the user needs are, you won&#39;t build the right thing. Do research, analyze data, talk to users. Don&#39;t make assumptions. Have empathy for users, and remember that what they ask for isn&#39;t always what they need.

### 2. Do less

Government should only do what only government can do. If we&#39;ve found a way of doing something that works, we should make it reusable and shareable instead of reinventing the wheel every time. This means building platforms and registers others can build upon, providing resources (like APIs) that others can use, and linking to the work of others. We should concentrate on the irreducible core. **Do not recreate the wheel**

### 3. Design with data

In most cases, we can learn from real world behavior by looking at how existing services are used. Let data drive decision-making, not hunches or guesswork. Keep doing that after taking your service live, prototyping and testing with users then iterating in response. Analytics should be built-in, always on and easy to read. They&#39;re an essential tool.

### 4. Do the hard work to make it simple

Making something look simple is easy. Making something simple to use is much harder - especially when the underlying systems are complex - but that&#39;s what we should be doing. Don&#39;t take &quot;It&#39;s always been that way&quot; for an answer. It&#39;s usually more and harder work to make things simple, but it&#39;s the right thing to do.

### 5. Iterate. Then iterate again

The best way to build good services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release minimum viable products early, test them with actual users, move from alpha to beta to live adding features, deleting things that don&#39;t work and making refinements based on feedback. Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons. If a prototype isn&#39;t working, don&#39;t be afraid to scrap it and start again.

### 6. This is for everyone

Accessible design is good design. Everything we build should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. If we have to sacrifice elegance - so be it. We&#39;re building for needs, not audiences. We&#39;re designing for the whole country, not just the ones who are used to using the web. The people who most need our services are often the people who find them hardest to use. Let&#39;s think about those people from the start.

### 7. Understand context

We&#39;re not designing for a screen, we&#39;re designing for people. We need to think hard about the context in which they&#39;re using our services. Are they in a library? Are they on a phone? Are they only really familiar with Facebook? Have they never used the web before?

### 8. Build digital services, not websites

A service is something that helps people to do something. Our job is to uncover user needs, and build the service that meets those needs. Of course much of that will be pages on the web, but we&#39;re not here to build websites. The digital world has to connect to the real world, so we have to think about all aspects of a service, and make sure they add up to something that meets user needs.

### 9. Be consistent, not uniform

We should use the same language and the same design patterns wherever possible. This helps people get familiar with our services, but when this isn&#39;t possible we should make sure our approach is consistent. This isn&#39;t a straitjacket or a rule book. Every circumstance is different. When we find patterns that work we should share them, and talk about why we use them. But that shouldn&#39;t stop us from improving or changing them in the future when we find better ways of doing things or the needs of users change.

### 10. Make things open: it makes things better

We should share what we&#39;re doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets - howlers are spotted, better alternatives are pointed out, the bar is raised. Much of what we&#39;re doing is only possible because of open source code and the generosity of the web design community. We should pay that back.

## Development Approach

Utilize open source technologies wherever possible.

Open by default.

Develop with re-usability and collaboration in mind.

## Metro.net Rules

**View** [**Dropbox Lifeboat content guidelines**](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Lifeboat-new-content-guides-and-practices-for-metro.net--BOcyCQjZE6trxKD1~jYBeFMMAQ-J5G2uQRbXH0yYMt8hcQxl) **for latest iteration.**

#### Use plain language

Metro&#39;s website is our main touchpoint for the general public and needs to be accessible to people from all walks of life. All content posted to the page needs to be written at a 7th grade reading level or below. This helps us make sure that people from varying backgrounds and education levels can access and engage with Metro.

#### Have clearly defined goals

In order to adequately measure and determine how successful a webpage is and make iterative improvements, we need to have goals that align with user needs. If needed, a digital assessment form can be provided to help with this process.

#### Content should be on brand

In addition to being accessible, web copy should follow Metro brand guidelines on tone and voice. Specific guidance can be found at [brand.metro.net](https://brand.metro.net/).

**Metro&#39;s website is about our service, project and programs, not our organizational chart** ; therefore:

- **No departmental pages**! The website is for riders and information needs to be presented in terms of its value in the customer journey. On the projects side, if a program, practice area, process or concept needs to be explained to give context for an active project, it can be a &#39;how we plan and build&#39; page and include contact information for an expert on that subject. These pages can also include links to plans and other documents that are relevant to said program, practice area, process or concept. Example [template of web content considerations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13QpNef91JzUwRjdkV-qV9lHqIlBfm4_0/view).

- Other than the Board members (and maybe top executive managementâ€¦), **no bios and headshots** should appear on the website. Calendar items for specific events in the Metro Conversations series or other events that may have guest speakers or panelists may include a short bio as part of the event information.

#### No more &#39;web requests&#39;!

Please do not send us copy that has already been finalized for posting verbatim. If copy needs to be updated, provide information on what should be changed to your Marketing Rep for copyediting into the page according to guidelines above. This will help us ensure consistency in tone and voice throughout the site.

#### Date-specific events

Events should be created using the calendar tool instead of a webpage for efficiency and search engine optimization.

#### Metro.net is not an archive

To avoid legal quandaries and ensure proper ownership of content, we&#39;d like to reiterate that departments are responsible for their own records. Metro.net is a convenience copy not a records system, and when the content is no longer active we should be able to delete it from metro.net If Records Management is asked to locate something, they will reach out to the content creators&#39; departments. It is their responsibility to comply with the records policy and retention schedule, not metro.net.

#### Bi-annual Metro.net review

We will run a bi-annual audit of the site to identify low-performing pages and pages that haven&#39;t been updated regularly to see if they should be removed for the site. Reviewing analytics and feedback is an important part of regular cleaning and maintenance of the site, and is meant to ensure our customers have a website that is fast, relevant, and easy to use. Pages that are flagged for review will be shared with marketing to determine next steps.

## **How Marketing can Help**

Marketing should avoid committing to **new** web projects without first checking in with the webteam. Don&#39;t start with the assumption that our partners need a web page, website, web application. We do not have capacity and even if we did, web priorities are tied to Metro&#39;s strategic goals.

Step 1: Do a Project Assessment with your partner. [Project Assessment script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwfI82QxUth5KYaptocRek-kFbwtDwj8hticzqNbIUs/edit?usp=sharing)

Step 2: Write [Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VeCsv2JO7rgdYQshNjy0Sf4fUcacXtzxkInfsU_SGbc/edit?usp=sharing)
