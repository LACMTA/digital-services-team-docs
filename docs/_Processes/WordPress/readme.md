# WordPress Usage
## Overview

On October 20, 2009, at the request of Marc Littman, DEO of Public Relations, Douglas Goodwin and Sharie Powell worked with Steve Hymon to create a daily blog that covered Metro's Board of Director and general activities. [The Source, Metro Transportation News and Views](https://web.archive.org/web/20091023024519/http://thesource.metro.net/), went live. With a directive to publish 5 to 7 stories per day to communicate to a new audience totaling 11,902 stories, 20,438 images, and 23 evergreen pages to date.

## Project Timeline

Over a decade later, a WordPress Network of over 15 sites have been built on various platforms:

- The Source, using the [Headways](https://headwaythemes.com/) theme framework, is initially hosted inside the Metro IT Network;
- El Pasajero, the Source's Spanish language sister site, created in April 2011 with Jose Ubaldo as Editor;
- Both sites migrated to WordPress VIP (on Douglas Goodwin and Sharie Powell's departure in 2012); 
- The Source and [El Pasajero](https://web.archive.org/web/20141218190402/http://elpasajero.metro.net/) redesigned with shared Bromley theme on WordPress VIP's multisite blog network in November 2014;
- The Source and El Pasajero migrated back in-house to Amazon Web Services (AWS) instances when Douglas Goodwin returns to Metro in 2015; 
- Vanity websites created to address department requests for additional online project information; and
- Metro Lifeboat websites launched to address performance and archival issues on legacy Metro website in 2021.

### Vanity Sites

To address a demand for project-related, date-sensitive topical or 'vanity' websites that separately housed with [Metro's Report to the Communities of LA County](http://media.metro.net/about_us/finance/images/annual_report/annual_report_fy15.pdf) on Squarespace by Akemi Shimbasi in 2015. A self-hosted solution was preferred and subsequent sites were built using WordPress.
