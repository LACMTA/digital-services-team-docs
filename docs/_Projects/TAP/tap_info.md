    - Santa Monica BBB Vendor Directory 
        - Sam emailed 10/7 saying BBB eliminated cash collection on their system and need to transition riders to TAP. They requested a BBB TAP vendor directory, but might want to revisit with the partner to see what other support materials or efforts are being done to support this.
        - Questions: 
            - What does this accomplish that the regular TAP vendor directory does not? 
            - Are they currently collecting fares? 
            - How are they communicating the elimination of cash?
            - What does the branding need to look like? How are we differentiating the regular TAP vendor directory from this version?
            - What are the goals/KPIs for this effort? 
            - How will they track/measure the effectiveness of this piece? 
            - Are there other support materials we are responsible for to support this effort?
