## Line Changes
### Data Source

As of 8/16/2021, the lines are populated from the following spreadsheet:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EUjBZsCiDYzu3r83Pg3oXCv5_Y0A1wxMLm0QY8NA3yw/edit#gid=1850985258](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EUjBZsCiDYzu3r83Pg3oXCv5_Y0A1wxMLm0QY8NA3yw/edit#gid=1850985258)

### Preparing the data

1. Make a copy of the spreadsheet above
   
2. In the new copy, clear out `columns D` thru `P` to fill them for the current update

### Updating the Google data
1. Go through the **Take One** document provided by the operations team and update the line descriptions based on service, route, and scheduling changes.

2. Validate line descriptions to make sure they all make sense.

3. After updates are complete, pass the spreadsheet over to marketing colleague (Antonio) for editing of descriptions to separate into 3 categories

!!! note
  When the schedule `PDFs` are not ready yet make a new column for old ones as a reference.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to generate the JSON file
