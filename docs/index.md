# Welcome

This documentation is a resource for the Marketing team at Metro that can be utilized for on-boarding, collaboration, and centralizing information.

Documentation either does not exist, is outdated, exists on old platforms, or exists across multiple platforms used by different people.  There is a need to centralize and keep documentation up-to-date for the entire team to use and reference.

## Sections

The documentation is loosely organized into the following structure:

### [Processes][processes-overview]

Organizational processes like shakeup procedure, project phases, community meetings, internal workflows, etc.

### [Projects][projects-overview]

Projects have defined goals, deliverables, and/or timelines.

### [Software and Services][software-overview]

Internal and external software, services, and administrative resources. These are products that are not created internally.

## Questions

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
