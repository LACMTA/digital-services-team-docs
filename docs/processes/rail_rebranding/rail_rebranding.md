# Metro Rail Rebranding
In preparation for the Regional Connector project, Metro changed the rail lines from colors to letters. The so-called Regional Connector project currently being built to connect a pair of lines that dead-end into Downtown Los Angeles will come online, as well, reorganizing and consolidating the number of existing transit lines. Officials hope that the new naming system reduces confusion and makes traveling across the system smoother for local strap-hangers and tourists alike.
