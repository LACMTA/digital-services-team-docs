# Action Group Information

!!! note
    This is a a evolving document (that you can be involved in working on)! The most recent version can be found here: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Brand-Discussion-Meeting-1013--BUO9vFecgOS9kP5djc19HNd5Ag-LwVPHePeIX40ic67cZgkI

## The Why

- It’s 2021, the world has changed, and it’s time for us to map out our collaboration – which impacts our work and the Metro brand. We need to figure out how all of our functions work together. Our customers are depending on us. It’s up to us to figure this out. 
- We have strategic plans that are good visions. We’re looking to address how to implement the visions. **We have the flag at the top of the mountain, but we need the paths to get there.**
- Doing the work on the ground, we recognize that we’re working on many of the same issues and share similar challenges. (The current teams/areas of concentration are not set up to work across borders.)
    - NextGen example (we have Signage Service Alert templates, ArcGIS basemaps)
    - [+Potential Service Design Projects: A List](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Potential-Service-Design-Projects-A-List-sIJhwQ6QbXWTz3dY57nj7) 
    - Our “boots on the ground” collaboration is crucial to our success
- We have many more major projects coming up. Because we need to be able to grow capacity, and don’t have more staff, we need to be more efficient.
    - We need the foundational nuts and bolts to tackle bigger problems (openings, service design)
- All of this needs to be designed to enable transitioning to what the agency needs, especially with the Realignment (focusing on CX, Service Design through-lines)
- [+Design Systems Planning References](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Design-Systems-Planning-References-dwGFnoWbFaBIHsXArcyx4) 
    - Where things are today, what we’d like to get to


## The Plan
- We see these as foundational items that need to be in place for cross-functional collaboration on a systemic design systems-based level, to prepare for all the upcoming projects, openings, etc. 
- They will entail an iterative approach, with a product process, with priorities and backlogs, determined by the Action Groups. They will be a work in progress.


- Short-term: 
        - **updating** ***brand.metro.net*****, Paper docs/folders content**
        - **Guiding Principles & Values** (Goals, “The Metro Way”)
            - Design Ethics (Design Justice)
        - **Documentation Wiki (ongoing)**
            [+GitHub Repository "Wiki” – Notes: Former/current-categories](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/GitHub-Repository-Wiki-Notes-Formercurrent-categories-8Iaaeh3cYlMtEk2dvmqnQ##:uid=016207945560185485858349&amp;h2=Former/current-categories) 
        - 
- Long-term:
        - **All-Encompassing Design Systems/Brand Guidelines**
            - **Digital Design System**
            
    

**We have these needs to implement the Strategic Plan**
DRAFT to work out together:

| **Initiatives** | **updating brand.metro.net, Paper docs/folders content** (near-term)| **Guiding Principles & Values**(asap)| **Documentation Wiki** (ongoing)| **All-Encompassing Design Systems/Brand Guidelines** (long-term)| **Digital Design System** (long-term)|
|---|----|----|-----|-----|-----|
|**Summary**   | This group will work together to implement pertinent updates to current brand guidelines site.  | This group will work to create a common set of guiding principles and values that tie together all our teams.                | This group will work to implement a collaborative platform for Marketing to document processes, projects, decisions, etc.            | This group will work together to plan and pivot for cross-functional design collaboration - guidelines, content, tools, etc.       | This group will work to create component libraries for designers and developers.   |
| **What’s Included** <br>**(will evolve)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | - Service names<br>- Signage page<br>- Fleet page<br>- Video guidelines<br>- Infographic guidelines<br>- Writing Guide? TBD | - Principles<br>- Values<br>- Vision<br>- Goals<br>- Metrics<br>- Order, Clarity, Satisfaction, Quality, Boundaries<br>- Including mapping the customer experiences, defining what is crucial in service for customers and public engagement | - Onboarding<br>- Processes<br>    - Workflows (could be another Action Group)<br>- Projects<br>- Software<br>- Specs<br>- Contacts | - Guiding Principles (is another Action Group)<br>- Brand/Identity<br>- Digital Design System (is another Action Group)<br>- Signage and Wayfinding<br>- Fleet<br>- Marketing Guidelines<br>- Photography<br>- Icons/Symbology<br>- Figuring out best digital platform tools | - Digital Design Toolkit<br>- Web Component Library<br>- Maintenance process<br>- Implementation (metro.net, contractor-built sites, etc.) |
| **People Interested – Action Group**||||||
| **People Interested – Contributor Capacity**|||||||
| **Roles**<br>(to develop together)<br><br>- these Action Groups will have the authority to set the vision<br>- define which areas are more horizontal; **pick pilot projects that require deeper-dives/kick-offs**<br>- who are decision-makers for which components||||||

**All-Encompassing Design Systems/Brand Guidelines**

- The bullets below aren’t a complete list, and don’t mean that any one group is solely in charge of them (several run across departments)
- That’s why many of our projects will benefit from cross-functional collaboration, and systems built together for more efficiency

| Across All| Design Studio| Digital|SEGD| Marketing|
|--|--|--|--|--|
| - Guiding Principles & Values<br>    - Design Ethics <br>    <br>- How we work across teams<br>- How to work with us<br><br><br>- Metro Service Names<br>- Line Letters<br>- Icons <br>- Map Guidelines | - Brand Guidelines<br>    - Name, Logo, Color, Typography<br>    - Illustrations<br>    - Photography<br>    - Video<br>- Project Map Guidelines | - Digital Design System | - Service Alert Templates<br>- Diagrammatic/ Line Maps<br>- Fleet Design<br>- Pictograms<br>- Permanent and temporary wayfinding<br>- Industrial design | - Voice & Tone<br>- Messaging Guidelines<br>- Content Design Best Practices<br>- available “Metro surfaces”, etc |


## The Rally
- There are these needs, now is the time – this is to kick-off the conversation
- We can work more efficiently together when we fill these gaps
- We’d like everyone to feel empowered to collaborate – to build the paths needed
    - Action Groups can collaboratively determine roles, schedules, starting priorities, backlogs 
    - We don’t have all the answers, that’s why we need Action Groups to address issues together
- Can we join forces? Who’s interested?

**Next Steps**

- Each Action Group will kick-off
    - Each Action Group will decide how often they meet
    - Core Action Groups/fellowship will also provide through-lines
****- There’s available shared knowledge on what’s worked for teams (see resources below)
- We’d also benefit from additional training
    - Agile training, project management training
    - Service design training

**Next Questions**

- Budget for potential tools
- How exactly will all of our teams correlate with CX?
    - Defining CX to be broader than for just riders, also public engagement with communities
    - There are linked goals across the two areas of concentration (projects will never be designed optimally for riders unless the input from them is front and center)
    - How do we better work together with Aaron’s team?
        - SEGD working with Cassie on better bus stops design
        - translate, interpret, implement the changes needed from CX plans data
        - we are also designers of feedback loops about CX and improvements
