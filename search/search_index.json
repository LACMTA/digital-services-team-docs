Metro.net is rarely the \u201csilver bullet\u201d solution to your business goals. Consider where and how people spend their time these days. We all have a regular communications ecosystem we use to discover, connect and act with the world around us. This ecosystem includes our social media timelines on Facebook and Instagram, search engines like Google, and our favorite websites, apps and channels.  To engage our target audiences, it is critical we know where people are, what they need and entice them with the most compelling messages to take the actions we want them to take. We will work with you to build a strategy and tactical plan that addresses the entire communications ecosystem for each audience.</p> <p>Defined audience. Metro.net is not for Metro, it\u2019s for the people we serve in Los Angeles County. Every section, page, piece of content or call-to-action must have a defined audience.

In order to adequately measure and determine how successful a webpage is and make iterative improvements, we need to have business goals that align with Vision 2028 and information the audience needs.

Therefore: </p> <p>Customer-oriented pages only! The website is for customers and information needs to be presented in terms of its value in their customer journey. On the projects side, if a program, practice area, process or concept needs to be explained to give context for an active project, it can be a \u2018how we plan and build\u2019 page and include contact information for an expert on that subject. These pages can also include links to plans and other documents that are relevant to said program, practice area, process or concept.

The vision for this basemap is to bring greater consistency across Metro\u2019s maps, from static printed maps to online interactive applications, for all types of project and service maps.</p> <p>Our new custom basemap will improve efficiency in creating branded online and printed maps by streamlining the styling process, reducing the amount of manual work required to style public-facing maps to Metro brand specifications.</p> <p>This base map is currently in beta version 1.0.4 as of 6/23/21. It is available to select teams as Metro\u2019s Design and Marketing teams refine the map and surrounding processes.</p> <p>Metro\u2019s ArcGIS Online environment includes shared update groups for individual projects and efforts, where files can be shared for collaboration with the Metro team. As with all public-facing information, please work with your Marketing Rep to gain access to the group for your project.</p>  <p>USE CASES The process for using the custom basemap will vary depending on the format of your final deliverable.
